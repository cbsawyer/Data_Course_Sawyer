Last commit, don't know how to fix this thing cause it won't merge right. Starting over, renaming to READMEoldfile
Please tell me I brought this bitch back
I think that might have fixed the name of the file back to be correct.
Looks like it worked! For the record: to rename a file, the mv command followed by oldfilename then newfilename works
I can add a few lines at a time, too. Characters don't matter. Just had to learn the hard way how to conceptualize the differene between local files and the repository.
Gonna have to ask about how to easily merge local and repository files. Things online showed me how to compare the diff using pull requests, but no git pull commands created successful pulls for the same reason. gonna figure this out on thursday, maybe.
so I can make ALL the changes I need, followed by one add command to create a rough draft of sorts, then commit to quote unquote save changes, and push to sync this info with the online repository, I think?
so my merge problem was probably because i made edits on the repository, then didn't PULL back to my local files before making edits. so I had edits on the repository, and some on my local files, and those couldn't sync because neither was more correct, maybe? Idk I wish it was easier to compare and solve those discrepancies. Guess that's a problem with this approach, rather than a constant sync. Just have to remember these two systems aren't the same, and give and take needs to happen between them.
So echo is write, add is enter, commit is save, push is to send it and sync it to the repository, pull is to pull changes from the repository to here. I'll try to figure out what each command means in and out of context as we move along
Guess I'm adding another line
I know how to add stuff, but idk how to take away yet
so I wonder what the -m means in the commit line. Without it, it gets grumpy. Guessing it just means the naming of the default, most recent commit name target.

guess I'm gonna just keep chunking away. gonna do more commits at some point tomorrow
k looks like it can handle quotes within quotes, that's good, at least.
