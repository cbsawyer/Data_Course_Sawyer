Last commit, don't know how to fix this thing cause it won't merge right. Starting over, renaming to READMEoldfile
Please tell me I brought this bitch back
I think that might have fixed the name of the file back to be correct.
Looks like it worked! For the record: to rename a file, the mv command followed by oldfilename then newfilename works
I can add a few lines at a time, too. Characters don't matter. Just had to learn the hard way how to conceptualize the differene between local files and the repository.
Gonna have to ask about how to easily merge local and repository files. Things online showed me how to compare the diff using pull requests, but no git pull commands created successful pulls for the same reason. gonna figure this out on thursday, maybe.
