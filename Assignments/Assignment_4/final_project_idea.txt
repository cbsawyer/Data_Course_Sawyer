1. Done

2. I'm double dipping with Dr. Ogden's Molecular Evolution and Bioinformatics class. So we're taking DNA/protein sequence data for at least 2 genes, and a minimum of 30 taxa. Doing alignments and phylogenetic trees, comparing sequences and relatedness
 
3. DNA seq, or protein seq. Going to be sourcing from NCBI databases. Gonna do lit searches for relatedness once my group has decided on an organism/gene set. Little nervous on SIZE that it's gonna take. So I'm hoping to find a well conserved gene, with just a small section of the genome that is regularly sequenced, rather than whole genome sequences.
